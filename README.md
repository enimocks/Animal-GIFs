# Physics-Giphy

## About
This game has pre-populated buttons on a variety of physics topics. You can also add your own buttons by typing them in, and then clicking the "Submit" button. Click a button/topic to display paused GIFs retrieved via the Giphy API. The GIFs load in a paused state, but clicking any one of them will animate it, and clicking again will pause.
